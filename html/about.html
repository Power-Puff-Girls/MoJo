      <p>Hi my name is Shelby. I’m from Maryland but currently living in the great city of Seattle. We often perceive sharing our feelings as being negative. Feelings shouldn’t be ignored and taking care of our mental health is taking care of ourselves. MOJO allows us to do just that.</p>

      <p>Hi, Raven Delaney here, from Kansas City, Missouri. Temporarily in Seattle, Washington for school.
        MoJo is important because it will hopefully help destigmatize mental health issues and help people keep tabs on their emotional state.</p>

        <p>Hi, my name is Ashlyn! I am from San Diego California.  I currently live in the Seattle area with my kids. Our society has a hard time addressing mental health issues and that leads to higher suicide rates, violence and all around division in every aspect of our lives. I am passionate about MoJo because it helps address our individual mental health through introspection and awareness of resources available.</p>

      <p>Hi I am Rosalyn. I am from Kirkland and currently living in Bellevue. I have struggled with depression for most of my life. There were times that I didn't want to talk to anyone. That is why MoJo is important to me. I want people like me to have a safe place to focus on their mental health.</p>
