Vision
What is the vision of this product?
	The vision of MoJo is to help users get a better gauge of their mood from daily entries to a weekly report.
What pain point does this project solve?
	Diaries are great, but they are not able to tell you when you need help or if you have been doing better recently. MoJo is here to help with daily introspection in the constant battle for mental health.
Why should we care about your product?
	MoJo is important because mental health has a stigma around it that should be broken. MoJo is important in every work force. Especially the tech industry. We want everyone to know that they are not alone. That their feelings are valid and their health is important.
